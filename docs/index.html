										<p>
										  We analyzed the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set from the <a href="http://nanograv.org/">North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav)</a> for pulse jitter, the effect that individual pulses look different from the very stable average pulse shape. The result is an increased uncertainty on our times of arrival and therefore <b>pulsar timing experiments must properly model jitter as a significant component of noise within our Galactic-scale detector</b>. While the dependence of this effect with radio frequency has been investigated over broad frequency ranges, including in a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/819/2/155/meta">paper from our 9-year data set</a>, this is the first study that investigate the functional form of the frequency dependence. We detected jitter in 43 of the 48 pulsars analyzed, with 30 of them showing significant frequency dependence.

												    The "miracle" of pulsar timing relies on the fact that the <b>average pulse shape of pulsars is very stable</b>. Over the course of decades, we can therefore determine when a set of pulses arrives at our telescopes very precisely.
												  </li>

												  <li>
												    Since their discovery, it has been known that individual pulses from pulsars do not resemble their average pulse shape. that means that while the <b>climate</b> of the pulsar magnetosphere is extremely stable, there is signicant <b>weather</b> on the timescale of a single rotation.

												  </li>
												  <li>
			       									    Calculating a time of arrival (TOA) relies on fitting a template pulse shape to a data pulse shape. This assumption relies on the fact that the data shape is an exact copy of the template shape, scaled and shifted. Since the average data shape is actually made of individual pulses all of different shapes, the assumption of "matched filtering" is broken and <b>we must account for this effect in estimating our TOA uncertainties</b>.

Without jitter, as the S/N gets very large, we expect the spread in the points to go to zero. We see that this is not the case and that there is a constant spread out to high S/N.</p>

													Rather than examine the TOAs produced in our final data set, we return to the calibrated data profiles with finer time resolution, typically broken into 1 or 2 minute integrations, allowing us to <b>probe jitter in short timescales</b>. We perform our analysis with the NANOGrav software package <a href="https://mtlam.github.io/PyPulse/">PyPulse</a>.

													</li>

												  <li>

													  For each individual observation in our data set, we assume that the "initial" timing model is not perfect but fairly good. We fit for a modification to the timing model and subtract all frequency-dependent delays over the course of each observation to remove unknown dispersion, profile evolution, and more. We are left over with <b>short-term timing residuals</b>.

													</li>

													<li>
													  Once we have our set of short-term timing residuals, we plot them as a function of pulse signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. If there was no jitter, we would expect that as the S/N goes to infinity, that the spread of the residuals would go to zero. Instead we see that as the S/N gets larger, the spread remains constant, due to the <b>random nature of jitter</b>.
													</li>

													<li>

													  We must also account for a separate effect due to the interstellar medium, which causes slight pulse shape changes as well. We can predict what the amplitude of <b>scintillation noise from scattering measurements</b>, such as in the analysis on our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04490">9-year data set</a>.

															  While the amplitude of jitter varies per pulsar, we found that the <b>rule of thumb for the amplitude</b> is that the timing variations from jitter are roughly 1% of a pulsar's period.
										
															</li>

										

															<li>
																Jitter was seen to correlate with the the average pulse width as well as the number of components that make up a pulse shape. Because <b>pulse shapes are complex</b>, our method simplifies the timing variations to a single number for each pulsar at each frequency.


															<li>

															  For the bright millisecond pulsar B1937+21, we were able to test the statistics of <b>jitter between its main pulse with its interpulse</b>. We found that the values were largely consistent.
															</li>
															<li>
															  We we do not expect there to be time dependence to jitter, we investigate this possibility in two of our best pulsars. We see that some slight variations in the pulsar J1909-3744 are likely due to radio frequency interference and that, if so, <b>the intrinsic value of jitter may be lower, and the pulsar may be even more precise than we can currently measure</b>.

															    As new, larger telescopes come online, it is important to take jitter into account as the dominant source of TOA uncertainty over noise in the electronics. Building a larger telescope or a receiver that covers wider frequency does not reduce the jitter noise. The only way to <b>reduce jitter is by observing a pulsar for more time</b>. Breaking arrays of telescopes into "sub-arrays" may also be useful in certain cases. 


															  </li>


						<li>

						  Since jitter is becoming so dominant, it is an important factor to consider in the design of new telescopes. As NANOGrav looks to develop <b>new concepts for a dedicated pulsar timing array telescope</b>, numbers like these feature heavily in those calculations.


																</li>
																<li>
																For telescopes currently observing in the <b>worldwide International Pulsar Timing Array</b> effort, we may decide that certain telescopes should observe pulsars which are heavily dominated by the effect of jitter, while other more sensitive telescopes should focus on weker pulsars. These analyses, however, must be understood in greater depth.
																</li>



																<li>

																As with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), we must understand all of our sources of noise and form our "<b>noise budget</b>" so that we can produce a believable detection of gravitational waves.
